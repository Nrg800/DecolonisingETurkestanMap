# DecolonisingETurkestanMap
A public map and gazetteer that contains Uyghur names and translations for places in Xinjiang/East Turkestan instead of Chinese Names


The gazetteer was based off Shahit.biz scraping of Xinjiang administrative levels, and geocoded using Baidu geocoder (using Chinese names). 
Translations have been done by multiple people and will be crowdsourced futher, special props goes to Shahit.biz for a number of translations and a resources to help reverse translate Chinese to Uyghur-che.
